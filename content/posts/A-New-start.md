It’s been a while since I last updated my blog… 😅 Life has been busy as a beeeeee🐝 as I’ve been adjusting to a new lifestyle after starting high school here in the United States. 🇺🇸 I’ve been having a greaaaaat time exploring the swimming pool 🏊‍♂️ and diving into the robotics club 🤖—both are absolutely awesome!

Oh, and you might have noticed a big 💥 change in the blog’s theme. Yup, I switched from **Cleanwhite** to **Papermod**! 📝 It feels so much more refreshing, don’t you think? 🎨



I’ll be posting updates here, but not on a strict schedule, so stay tuned! 🌟 >w<
