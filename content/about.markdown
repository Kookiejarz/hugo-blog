👋Hi, I’m Kenneth, an international student at St. John’s Preparatory School in Danvers, Massachusetts. 🌍📚 I’m deeply passionate about technology, programming, and innovation. 💻 Python is my favorite programming language, and I’ve used it extensively in various projects, including developing scripts for efficient multitasking on Linux servers, 🖥️⚙️ and integrating APIs for enhanced functionality. 🔗✨

At school, I’m part of the swimming team 🏊‍♂️ and enjoy exploring different academic challenges, such as my summer project researching rare diseases. 🧬📊 I’m also focused on improving my skills in fields like finance and computer science 💰💾 as I prepare for university applications. 🎓 My long-term goal is to attend a prestigious institution like MIT, though I’m also considering other top universities with strong programs in these areas. 🌟

When I’m not studying or coding, I’m constantly learning and pushing myself to new heights 🚀, eager to see where my passions and hard work will lead me! 💡
